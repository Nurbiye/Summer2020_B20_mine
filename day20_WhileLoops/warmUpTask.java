Tasks:
    1. write a program that can print the numbers between 1 to 100.
                if the number is divisible by 3, do not print it
    2. write a program that can ask the user enter a number for five times and
    the returns the sum of those five numbers
    3. Write a program that calculates the sum of numbers entered by the user
    until user enters a negative number.
            hint: you need an infinite loop
    4. Write a program that can return the factorial number of any given number
        Ex:
            input: 5
            output: 120
            because: 5! = 5 * 4 * 3 * 2* 1 = 120
